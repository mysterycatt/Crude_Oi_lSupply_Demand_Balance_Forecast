Analytics & Technology in Oil Trading

Based on historical information obtained from JODI http://www.jodidb.org/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=93904 produce an oil analyst forecast for the 2019 Crude Oil Supply Demand Balance of Russia. Consider the following:

  •	Period: monthly data for each segment 
  
  •	Unit of measurement: thousand barrels per day (kb/d) 
  
  •	Country: Russian Federation 
  
  •	Segments to be completed: (Jan 2019 - Dec 2019): 
  
      o	Crude Oil Production 
      
      o	Crude Oil Imports 
      
      o	Crude Oil Exports 
      
      o	Refinery Throughput



In three bullet points also try to answer the following questions: 

(a)	Do you observe any seasonality or trend in the data?  

(b)	Is the country an importer/exporter of crude oil?  

(c)	What role geopolitics play (currently Russia is in a deal with OPEC, what would happen to your forecast if that deal falls through)?
